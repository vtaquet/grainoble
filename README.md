Public version of the GRAINOBLE gas-grain astrochemical code

GRAINOBLE is a gas-grain astrochemical model that computes the temporal evolution of the chemical composition in the gas phase and on the interstellar grain surfaces. The approach is based on the rate equations introduced by Hasegawa et al. (1992) for a gas-grain treatment and allows you to follow the chemistry with fixed or evolving physical conditions. Among others, two of the main specifications of GRAINOBLE is the multiphase treatment for the formation and desorption of ices and the computation of the reaction probabilities of grain surface reactions with the Eckart model from quantum chemical calculations. 

The GRAINOBLE code, written in Fortran90, comes with two Python routines to run and analyse the simulations. GRAPP (GRAINOBLE APPLIER) allows you to execute GRAINOBLE for 1) individual simulations with constant physical conditions, 2) simulations for evolving physical conditions as function of distance, 3) model grids in which physical conditions are explored, 4) sensitivity analyses in which the distributions of key input parameters impacts the uncertainties of the model predictions. GRAN (GRAINOBLE ANALYSER) allows you to read the binary files generated by GRAINOBLE and visualise the results via different kinds of figures. 

For a full description of the physical and chemical processes included in the model and for some results, please take a look at my thesis manuscript, available here: http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00790641, and the publications listed below.

The instructions file describes the input files needed by GRAINOBLE, how to compile and execute the code, and the routines needed to analyze and visualise the results. The log_history file gives an overview of all previous versions of the code between 2012 and 2018.
