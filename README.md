Public version of the GRAINOBLE gas-grain astrochemical code

GRAINOBLE is a gas-grain astrochemical model which computes the chemical composition in the gas phase and on the interstellar grain surfaces. The approach is based on the rate equations introduced by Hasegawa et al. (1992) for a gas-grain treatment and allows you to follow the chemistry during a one-dimensional physical evolution (with varying density, temperature, and visual extinction). Two of the main novelties of GRAINOBLE is the multilayer treatment for the formation and desorption of ices following Hasegawa & Herbst (1993) and the computation of the reaction probabilities of grain surface reactions with the Eckart model from quantum chemical calculations. 

For a full description of the physical and chemical processes included in the model and for some results, please take a look at my thesis manuscript. You can find it here: http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00790641.

The instructions file describes the input files needed by GRAINOBLE, how to compile and execute the code, and the routines needed to analyze and visualise the results. The log_history file gives an overview of all previous versions of the code between 2012 and 2018.
